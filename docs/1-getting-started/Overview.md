Welcome to AIOU documentations!

AIOU is a new generation of high-performance public blockchains. The infrastructure is scalable, stable and allows low level customization for different business requirements. After the launch of AIOU Testnet, we have welcomed many new developers to the AIOU technical community.

These documentations are an entry point to AIOU ecosystem for new developers as well as those who are experienced. The documentations are maintained both by the AIOU community and by the core team â€” your help is always welcome! The documentation serves the purpose of providing a clear understanding of AIOU technology and ecosystem.

There are some prerequisites to get started with development on the AIOU networks:

* Mainstream coding and development experience
* No need for previous Blockchain development experience
* Understanding of AIOU basics or your business scenario/requirements

We sincerely welcome developers to AIOU!
